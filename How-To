This program is very simple and is 
my first program ever written so as 
itâ€™s a learning experience for me. 
I welcome newcomers to programming.

To get started;

1) make sure to have downloaded 
  hydra, nmap and netcat
2) open a terminal window.
3) cd into X22 directory 
4) type: ./X22
5) this should run the program and
   all you would have to do is wait
   for username and password at the 
   bottom of output
